# Power_Bi_Pizza_Insights_Project
Analyzing pizza sales data from a fictional pizzeria using Power BI to uncover trends, customer preferences, and sales patterns. Gain valuable insights into pizza orders, sizes, so we can make business decisions with data-driven analysis.
# Data Source #
The dataset used for this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shilongzhuang/pizza-sales) and contains 1 table with 12 relevant features
# Data Transformation #
The following data transformation steps were taken:
- Replaced values in "pizza_size column" (e.g., M to Medium).
- Removed "order_time" and "pizza_ingredients" columns as it didn't provide any value to my analysis.
- Renamed the column names from "pizza_name," "pizza_size," "quantity," and "category" to "Name," "Size," "Quantity," and "Category." 
-	A Calendar table was created from "order_date" column using the following DAX:
  
`calendar = calendar(min(pizza_sales[order_date]), max(pizza_sales[order_date]))`
-	Established the relationship between the two tables manually.

# DAX Measures #
The DAX measures formulated for this project are:

1.	Total Orders: `Total Orders = DISTINCTCOUNT(pizza_sales[order_id])`
2.	Total Sales: `Total Sales = sum(pizza_sales[total_price])`
3.	Total Pizzas Sold: `Total Pizzas Sold = sum(pizza_sales[Quantity])`
4.	Average Order Value: `AOV = [Total Sales]/[Total Orders]`

# Data Analysis and Visualization #
#### Top Metrics

The analysis of pizza names unveils captivating insights into the pizzeria's menu preferences. The "Thai Chicken Pizza" claims the top spot as the best-performing pizza, generating impressive sales of $43,434. Following closely is the "Barbecue Chicken Pizza" contributing significantly with sales totaling $42,768. Additionally, the "California Chicken Pizza" showcases strong popularity, raking in sales of $41,709.

#### Comprehensive Pizza Metrics
In the "Comprehensive Pizza Metrics" table, the analysis reveals that the category "Classic" illustrates a broad range of sizes, orders, pizzas sold, and sales figures. The category "Classic" demonstrates its popularity, with the highest number of orders for the "Small" size, reaching a remarkable 5,300 orders, while the least ordered falls under the "XX-Large" size, with a count of just 28 orders.

When examining the category's pizza sales, the "Small" size shines with distinction, having the highest pizzas sold, totaling 6,139. In contrast, the "XX-Large" size pizza in the "Classic" category has the lowest pizzas sold, reflecting a significantly modest count.

Furthermore, in terms of sales value, the "Veggie" category's "Large" size pizzas dominate, securing the highest sales among all combinations. On the contrary, the "Classic" category's "XX-Large" size pizzas exhibit the lowest sales value in this comprehensive analysis.

It's noteworthy to mention that the use of conditional formatting with icons in the "Orders," "Pizzas Sold," and "Sales" columns adds an additional layer of insight to this detailed examination, enabling easy identification of these metrics at a glance.

#### Sales Forecasting
Î™n the Sales Forecasting section, a line chart has been developed to provide insights into the anticipated sales trends for the upcoming months. This graph offers a visualization of sales over time, with the x-axis representing days, months, and years, and the y-axis representing sales figures. A addition to the graph is the inclusion of a forecasted line, extending into the future, supported by a 95% confidence interval. This line enables a visual prediction of sales trends, with projected values for specific dates.

The graph's illustration extends further with the integration of an average line, positioned at the level of $2,300. This reference line provides a clear benchmark  by which to evaluate the sales trajectory. Additionally, you can cleary see both the minimum and maximum points for sales across all dates. This demonstrates the range within which sales have varied, revealing the diversity in customer activity.

Looking into the furure and taking the example of February 20, the forecast predicts a projected sales amount of $2,490. This forecast provides valuable insights for strategic business planning. Furthermore, the graph's visualization aids in identifying potential growth or decline periods, enabling stakeholders to make informed choices.

#### Slicers
In order to provide a interactive experience, I've added two slicers into the dashboard: the Category Slicer and the Size Slicer. These slicers offer a focused and dynamic way to explore the data. With the Category Slicer, you can delve into sales trends for different pizza categories. On the other hand, the Size Slicer allows you to examine how different pizza sizes impact overall sales performance. These slicers give you the power to tailor your analysis based on your specific interests and questions, making it easier to uncover insights and trends.
